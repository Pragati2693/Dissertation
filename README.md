**CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION**



*1.1	Background*

Fortune magazine publishes the list of the world’s largest top 500 enterprises annually measured in terms of revenue since 1995. The listed companies stand as distinguished collection spotlighting the most influential and expansive corporation that steer the course of the worldwide economy. In the past decade Asian companies emerged as a major centre of the economy as seen from the increasing presence of the Asian companies in the Fortune Global list. The companies and the countries which dominated the world 20 years back have changed drastically due to the changes that took place with respect to economic, demographic and geopolitical over the time (Rymer, 2018). In 2021, despite of the impact of pandemic, sum of the revenues generated by companies listed in Global Fortune 500 was greater than one- third of the world’s GDP (Media, 2021).
The Fortune Global 500 ranks the top 500 public and private companies worldwide annually based on total revenue generated in the respective fiscal year. While profitability is important, revenue often plays a more crucial role in determining a company's value. An unprofitable company may still be seen favourably if its revenue is rising, suggesting potential for profitability with scale (Nairametrics, 2019).
As per Wikipedia contributors (2023), Asian companies accounted for only 15.4% of all the companies listed in Fortune Global 500 list in 1995, whereas in 2020 it has increased to 33.6%. By 2022, Asian companies accounted for approx. 45% of all the companies listed which reflect the rapid growth of Asia region. Along with China, for which the count of companies in the list is comparable to that of U.S., other advance economy such as Japan, Taiwan and south Korea also gained ground (Mei, 2022).
The remarkable expansion of Asian representation among the top tiers of worldwide commerce aligns with the region's escalating economic influence. According to IMF (2020) report Asia contributed to 35% of the global GDP in 2019, compared to 20% in 1995. Swift progress has been led by nations such as Japan, South Korea, as well as urban hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong, succeeded by the ascent of China, India, and the Southeast Asian region. The depiction within the Fortune Global 500 parallels this economic advancement. Nevertheless, Asia is characterized by significant diversity, showcasing substantial variations in developmental stages, industrial capacities, and global interconnectedness.
Given that there is sharp increase in the count of Asian companies in the list from last decade, it is important to examine if the geography of the company affect the ranking or longevity of a company in the list. Different sector has different requirement and the companies often choose sectors that align with the opportunities and resources available in their region. Thus, it is worth investigating sector and region along with other factor affect the survival of a company in the list.
 
*1.1.1	Survival of companies and industrial shift*

According to the American Enterprise Institute, fewer than 12% of companies listed on the Fortune 500 between 1955-2017 survived over that period. The rest went bankrupt, merged, acquired, or dropped off the list (Perry, 2017). The average survival time on the Fortune 500 and S&P 500 has declined each decade. At current churn rates, nearly half of the S&P 500 will turnover in the next 10 years (Perry, 2017).
Market dynamics like digitalization, social media, healthcare changes, and climate shifts have given rise to new Fortune 500 companies in the 21st century, unlike the oil and gas firms dominating previously (Viguerie et al., 2021). For instance, Etsy's stock soared over 200% during the pandemic as e-commerce surged, while digital health M&A leapt from $8 billion in 2019 to $50 billion in 2020 (Viguerie et al., 2021). Over the past decade, Information Technology has seen 20.7% annualized returns, far outpacing Energy's 4.3% (S&P, 2023). This illustrates the decline of some legacy industries and the rise of new digital leaders.
However, research into Asian companies in the Fortune Global (FG) 500 is limited. This dissertation helps fill that gap by analysing Asian firms from 2013-2022 across multiple dimensions and seeks to delve deeper into these dynamic shifts, investigating the factors influencing the inclusion.


*1.2	Objective*

For a company, to be included in the list is prestigious. A significant number of investors consider the Fortune 500 a reliable gauge of the present market conditions so as to understand a trend in the market, comparing the rising and falling of industries, sector trend and growth and decline of the economy of all country (Gausden, 2019). Analyzing the changing corporate environment of Asia by considering its presence in the Fortune Global 500 will yield novel viewpoints.
The key objectives of this dissertation are:
▪	To analyse the changing representation of Asian vs. non-Asian companies in the Fortune Global 500 over the past decade
▪	To compare the financial performance of Asian companies to the global average in terms of profit margins.
▪	To examine the sectoral composition of Asian firms and how it has evolved.
▪	To assess the factors influencing Asian companies’ survival in the Fortune Global 500 list over time
The dissertation aims to provide data-driven insights into Asia’s corporate landscape and its strengths, weaknesses, and strategic implications.
 
**1.3	Research Questions**

*1.	How has the representation of Asian and non-Asian companies in the Fortune Global 500 changed over the past decade?*

Finding the answer of the above research question is important in order to understand the shifting power dynamics in global market between East vs west and developing vs developed world. Keeping a track on rise of Asian companies and examining their representation in FG 500 list in past decade shed light on their growing prominence in the global market.

*1.1.	How does the financial performance of Asian companies compare to the global average and within Asia itself?*

Analysing Asian corporate performance goes beyond counting companies. It helps us understand financial health and competitiveness, revealing diversity within Asia. This knowledge informs targeted strategies for improvement, allows benchmarking, and offers a comprehensive view of Asia's corporate landscape, enriching our understanding.

*1.2.	What changes have taken place in both the sectoral makeup and profit margins (in context of sector) within Asian companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 over the last decade?*

Analysing sectoral shifts in Asia's corporate landscape tracks its economic evolution. It identifies emerging and declining industries, informs tailored policies, guides corporate strategies, showcases intra-Asian variations, and gauges global competitiveness. This nuanced industry perspective complements broader trends, offering valuable insights for smart policymaking and strategy.

*2.	What factors influences companies drop off or survival on the Fortune Global 500 list over time and apart from revenue and profit, do asset and size of the company also affect the ranking of companies in the list?*

The above question permits us to move beyond a mere glimpse and grasp the elements that facilitate the long-term prosperity of Asia's most prominent multinational enterprises.

**1.4	Organization**

This report is divided into 5 sections. The first section provides background information on the Fortune Global 500 list and states the objectives and research questions. The second chapter reviews existing literature on the changes in representation of Asian vs non-Asian companies in the Fortune 500 list over time and covers literature analysing factors influencing company survival on the list. The third outlines the qualitative and quantitative methods used in the analysis.

acknowledges limitations of the research. The chapter also discusses problems observed in the analysis and proposes solutions to address them.



**CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW**

*2.1	Shifting FG 500: Asian vs. Non-Asian Companies in the Last Decade*

*2.1.1	Surge in the Asian companies count in last decade*

Numerous contemporary investigations have recorded an ascending presence of Asian enterprises within the esteemed Fortune Global 500 listing throughout the last ten years. In the last ten years, areas in Asia like China, India, and Southeast Asia have undergone swift economic expansion and development. As a result of this economic progress, there has been a substantial rise in the count of companies conducting operations across diverse sectors within these regions.
Over the last decade, according to Tonby et al., (2019), a number of Asian nations have elevated themselves to the status of middle-income and even advanced economies. This shows the continuous process of industrialization and urbanization within the region, as well as the increasing demand and productivity growth, along with the vibrant corporate sector. GDP is the primary economic indication and in 2022 China’s GDP increased to 18.1 trillion
U.S. dollar from 8.5 trillion U.S. dollar in 2012, when compared to the GDP of the remaining BRIC nations—India, Russia, and Brazil—China secured the top position in that particular year and attained the second rank in the global GDP standings (Statista,2023). Starting from the year 2000, the proportion of Chinese companies listed on the Global 500 has surged from 2% to 27% in 2022, while the share of American companies has declined from 36% to 25% (Mei, 2022).
In India, the upsurge in the outsourcing and the export of services, in conjunction with deregulation on the domestic front, played pivotal roles in driving growth (Panagariya, 2008). As a result, there was a surge of fresh enterprises in technology services, banking, telecommunications, and other sectors. The administration reduced impediments to foreign investment and decreased corporate taxes to draw foreign direct investment (FDI), this resulted in Industries such as e-commerce, retail, and technology services experienced substantial growth due to expansions by corporations like Amazon, IKEA, and Google (Shashidhar, 2019). Registered companies in India grew from 2.2 million in 2010 to over 3.1 million by 2022 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 2022).
In a report published by Bain and Company (2022), it was found that IN Southeast Asia Foreign direct investment (FDI) is increasingly flowing into Southeast Asia. In 2021, FDI constituted a larger share of overall investment, reaching 17%, as compared to 15% in 2015 and a mere 9% in 2009. This consistent upward trajectory of foreign investment underscores the trust investors have in Southeast Asia, contributing to the expansion of innovative technologies like fintech.
Even though there is a collective rise in the count of Asian companies can be seen in the recent years, yet not all the countries in Asia are growing with the same pace. In research conducted on the comparative study between Chinese and Japanese firms listed in Fortune Global 500 list between 1995 to 2014 by C Hong (2017), it was found that while the count of
 
Chinese firm was increasing every year the count of Japanese companies continued to deaccelerate, as shown in below fig.
In another research paper “Owners of the World’s Listed Companies” conducted by Cruz, Medina and Yang (2019), which studied ownership of 10000 largest companies listed in 2017 found that the Global Market Capitalization of advance Asia (Japan, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong) excluding China was almost same as Europe, 21%, but for China and Emerging Asia it was 11% and less than 5% respectively. According to Chetwynd’s study in 2020, it is observed that while the count of Japanese corporations in the Fortune Global 500 remained consistent in the previous ten years, the presence of South Korean companies escalated from 15 to 25. Among the countries, China demonstrated the most rapid expansion, with significant state-owned enterprises and technological leaders like Huawei making their entry into the list (China Power Team,2019).


*2.1.2	Comparing profit Margin: Advance vs. Emerging Asian companies*

It is worth noting that Fortune Global 500 list the companies on the basis of revenue so it doesn’t suggest that the companies in the top of the list makes more profit than the lower ranking companies. In research, conducted on “Comparative Study on the Fortune Global 500—Basing on the 2005-2015 Ranking” by Long (2016) suggest that on comparing the six major countries -United States, China, Japan, Britain, France and Germany, on the basis of revenue, profit and industrial distribution it was found that the profit margin of U.S. companies was highest followed by China then Japan, France and Germany then Britain, however the count of the companies in the list between 2005-2015 also followed the same order.
According to Fortune, in 2022 the mainland China has 136 companies in the list followed by
U.S. 124 companies, nonetheless, among the leading five revenue-generating firms are Walmart, Amazon.com, State Grid, China National Petroleum, and Sinopec. Notably, only two of these entities originate from China (watermark feed, 2022)
According to McKinsey report published on “Corporate Asia: A capital paradox” Asian
enterprises commonly experience reduced returns on invested capital in comparison to North American businesses. This discrepancy can be attributed, at least in part, to their comparatively lower capital efficiency and productivity levels (Bradley et al., 2020).
But does that mean that all the Asian companies are on the lower side of the Marginal profit? As per the report by McKinsey on “The future of Asia: Decoding the value and performance of corporate Asia”, emerging Asian enterprises have elevated their portion of economic profits from 18 percent during 2005–07 to 38 percent in the span of 2016–18. In contrast, advanced Asian companies observed a decrease in their share from 35 percent to 31 percent within the same timeframe (Bradley et al., 2020). Also, Emerging Asia tend to have lower labour cost than Advance Asian and so the cost of manufacturing the product results in higher profit in emerging Asia and Advance Asia. For example, according to the Asian Development Bank's report in 2019, labour costs for manufacturing in Vietnam are less than 20% of those in South Korea. As a result of this cost difference, companies can enjoy increased profit margins.
A research paper conducted on “International expansion of emerging market enterprises: A springboard perspective” showed that the convergence of reduced expenses, diminished rivalry, benefits from being pioneers in the market, robust expansion, and increased adaptability allows numerous businesses in emerging Asian markets to attain greater marginal
 
profitability in comparison to their counterparts situated in more developed Asian economies
(Luo and Tang, 2007)


*2.1.3	Shift in Asian companies’ sector over the last decade*

Given that Fortune global list the companies from all sectors, there are 4 to 5 sectors companies which dominate the list or in other words there are some specific sector companies which generate large sum of revenue. The significant prevalence of conventional industries such as energy and automotive within the compilation suggests that these sectors continue to hold a predominant position in terms of generating revenue or employing other metrics that determine the ranking of these companies. In a research paper conducted on “a Snapshot of the world of Global Multinationals – An industry-based analysis of Fortune Global 500 companies” by Ogrean (2017) argued that the Financials sector takes a commanding position in the FG 500 ranking in categories such as the count of companies, revenues, profits, assets, and employees and the other sectors that exhibit strong performance encompass Energy, Automobile manufacturing and components, Technology, Healthcare, and Retail. The same research paper also argued that in 1996, the sectors that exhibited the greatest profit margins relative to their revenues included Pharmaceuticals, Petroleum refining, and Chemicals.
When it comes to Asian companies regarding growth in specific sector, several studies documented a rapid growth in finance sector in Asia in past decades. There has been a notable trend in recent years of an increase in finance sector companies in Asia compared to other regions, while at the same time a decrease in energy sector companies. Despite of the chaos that COVID-19 bought, fintech companies showed growth across all the regions.
In research, performed on Fortune Global 500 companies from 1994 to 1998 in order to analyse the structure of the world economy in 1990s and the rise and fall of hegemonic states, the study found that as per the financial expansion (during 1990s), the centre of productive advantage might move from North America to Asia in 21st century (Bergesen and Sonnett, 2001).
In research conducted on “10 Fintech trend for 2022/2023” it was observed that in a country where there is higher number of internet users than any part of the world, the dominance of the Chinese fintech giant is hardly unexpected. Given that in 2022, its e-commerce market in China was assessed at $1.2 trillion USD, while the United States, for instance, stood at
$811.03 billion (Statista Research Department, 2023). Combining all the factor together, e- commerce market, internet users and investment in FinTech sector, indicate that Chinese are leading the global fintech industry (Gilbert, 2019).
Also, as per Global Finance magazine, a decade ago, the most valuable companies were the large traditional, established blue-chip industries like, Exxon Mobil, AT&T, General Electric, basically Oil giants/energy sector companies, today all the companies in top 10 list, when consider market capitalization, are the tech companies like, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Ventura, 2023).


*2.1.4.	Growth in Tech Sector’s Marginal Profit over past decade*

Also, a major shift in the share of IT sector is seen in last 2 decade. In the research on Emerging Market (EM) change it was observed that the share of the IT sector accounted for 5% of the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) index and in 2018 it was close to 27%
 
but the sectors for which a significant reduction in the index weight were found are materials and telecommunications sector which accounted for 16.4% and 15.8% respectively in 1998, in 2018 it accounted for 7.9% and 4.5% (Rymer, 2018).
It is interesting to observe that when considering the companies listed in Fortune Global 500 list, it seen that the technologies companies were not in the list of top 10 in 2019, yet from the market value perspective (a company’s market shares multiplied by current market price) the top global companies were dominated by new tech companies (Yoshida, 2020).
A report published by Statista on revenue and profit of major software companies showed that Adyen accomplished the most substantial average annual revenue growth over the past five years, reaching 69.2%. Another report elucidates the principles governing expansion and profit margins within the software industry, proposing that the swiftest-growing software enterprises have the potential to triple or double their revenues over multiple years (Ahlawat et al., 2022).
But not all the Asian companies are performing well in the Technology sector. In recent times, a significant transformation has been observed in the technology sector of Asia, marked by a decrease in the prominence of major Japanese tech corporations and a simultaneous ascent of firms in other advanced Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China. The 2020 World Digital Competitiveness Ranking from the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) has been published, assessing nations' capabilities to effectively employ digital technologies across government, business, and society. These findings indicate Japan's lower standing compared to other countries, slipping to the 27th position from 23rd in 2019. Within the Asia-Pacific region, its ranking fell below that of countries like Singapore and Malaysia. In contrast, Japan's economic counterparts have made significant advancements: South Korea's ranking improved from 14th in 2018 to 8th, while China's surged from 30th to 16th (Arnold-Parra, 2021).


Taken together, the existing body of literature provides evidence of a substantial change within the globally influential Fortune 500 cohort, indicating an increased presence of Asian companies, while Western incumbents have relatively receded. Nevertheless, Asian enterprises still lag in specific vital industries and retain a heavy reliance on domestic and export markets. The trajectory of the next ten years might reveal whether these strategic disparities endure.
Apart from studying the changes in the count and sectorial changes of Asian and non-Asian companies in the FG 500 list occurred between 2013 – 2022, it is also important to study which sector and geography of the companies able to maintain its existence in FG 500 list in the past decade. As this dissertation is an analysis on the changes occur in last 10 years for Asian companies listed in FG 500, it should be reasonable to discuss if the existence of the companies in list is affected by the sector and region of the company apart from just revenue. If yes, then are there any other factor as well that affect the existence of the company in the list.


*2.2.	Survival analysis: FG 500 companies 2013-2022*

As per the American Enterprise Institute article, fewer than 12% of the companies have been on Fortune 500 list from 1955 to 2017 and the rest 88% either gone bankrupt, merged with (or were acquired by) another firm, or they still exist but have fallen from the top Fortune 500
 
companies (Mark J. Perry, 2017). Average age of survival of the companies in the list of Fortune 500 or
S&P 500 Index is decreasing every decade. Perry (2017) pointed out that as per the current Churn rate, almost half of the companies listed in S&P 500 Index will get replaced in the next 10 years.
In the recent years there has been a significant decline in the number of European companies to maintain its existence in the influential list. As per the article published by fortune, in the past decade the number of the Italian companies dropped from 8 to 5, Britain from 26 to 15 and France from 31 to 24. Only Germany was able to maintain a steady growth, from 29 to 30, while U.S. and China saw increase in big tech companies, no European or Japanese companies made a similar step forward. (Vanham and Gordon, 2023). Research also suggests that European companies underperform, especially in Technology, compared to other major countries like U.S. As per the report published by McKinsey on “Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap” between 2014 and 2019, large European companies significantly underperformed compared to other global companies across several key financial and investment metrics. This suggest that the geography of a company plays important role in the survival of a company.
Another research conducted on “A Study of Factors That support Longevity of Business Enterprises” concluded that the main factor that affect the longevity of a company are innovative capability, organizational system, organizational culture, resources and strategy (Galadanchi and Bakar, 2018).
In a research where Japanese and Chinese companies listed in Fortune Global 500 list, from 1995-2014, were analysed suggested that in case of increase in the number of financial and resource rich Chinese companies in the list was mainly due to the domestic advantages, very few number of Chinese firm which moved up in the ranking outreach beyond Chinese market, where as the fall in the number of Japanese firms from the list was mainly due to unaggressive approach toward the fast changing, competitiveness and innovative trend in the market, still most of the sustainable companies were Japanese companies (Hong et al., 2017). Another research conducted on “Factors determining the survival of the new companies” used logit model based on the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS) concluded that variables such as experience of founder, number of owners, capital, less debt and intellectual property right have positive relation with the probability of the survival of start-ups (Cegiełka, 2020)
Revenue is main factor in determining the ranking of the companies yet market capitalization, profitability, innovation and adaptability highly matters. As per a report by Investopedia, Economic activity, Government policy and geopolitical events and natural balance of supply and chain highly influence the market trend (Mitchell,2009), all these factor impact company’s revenues and thus ranking in the top list. As per McKinsey, 75% of the companies listed in S&P 500 will disappear from the list after 10 years, by 2027, the large enterprises are complex and vulnerable and they fail because of their inefficiency in anticipating the change of current trend towards sustainable development (Garelli, 2016).


Existing research papers have often focused on narrower timeframes or specific aspects. This dissertation offers a comprehensive perspective on the evolution of Asian firms across various dimensions over the past decade. While most studies concentrate on China or Asia as a whole, this dissertation distinguishes between emerging markets like India and advanced ones like South Korea, providing a nuanced view of Asia. It goes beyond mere firm counts to delve into sector trends, profitability, and margins, allowing for comparisons with global FG500
 
averages to identify Asia's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, existing research on factors influencing company survival mostly relies on qualitative methods like surveys and interviews. This dissertation, in contrast, employs a quantitative approach, utilizing Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and correlation methods to uniquely examines the factors causing Asian firms to drop off the list over time, linking survival to metrics like revenue, profit, and sector. This research yields valuable lessons for resilience and supplements quantitative data analysis with a literature review of macro factors influencing Asian economies and corporations. It doesn't just describe trends but offers practical insights for companies and governments to enhance Asia's global corporate competitiveness.


**CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY**

According to Beattie (2011), today the availability of data has transformed the business analysis method and these methods basically falls under 2 categories: Qualitative and Quantitative. Qualitative are subjective judgement which measure a company’s value which are not quantifiable, whereas Quantitative methods are involves application of different model use to measure and evaluate business performance in numerical terms. Quantitative models include: Indicator approach (in which performance is estimated by observing the relationship between indicators) and Econometric modelling (in which model tests the strength of relationship between datasets over time).
This report employs both qualitative and quantitative methods. The objective of this report is to analyse and find useful insights from the last 10 years of data and Microsoft Power BI is the best tool for this. To answer the research questions, data is analysed using the Power BI tool, known for its interactive visualizations and data-driven insights. Simple analyses on sector- wise company count, average revenue, and profit margin are visualized using column charts, tables, or pie charts, making Power BI the ideal choice. The data spans 10 Excel sheets, each containing company details, ranking, region, sector, profit, assets, revenue, and employee data for the years 2013 to 2022.
To answer the second research question (factors affecting the survival of companies in the list) quantitative approach is applied. For this part the company listed in 2013 is manually matched with the company listed in 2022 and then a new column is added in 2013 list called “Status” which contain 2 value “Y” – for that company exists in both 2013 and 2022 list and “N” -- if it doesn’t exist. And then Indicator approach for finding relationship between the factors responsible for survival of the company in the list. Using Chi-square test and Logistic Regression, the relation between survival of the company and other factor is tested, then correlation coefficient with Pearson’s method is used to find relation between rank and asset and size of the company (number of employees).
The existing problem and solution from the result obtain from analysis are identified using qualitative approach, to support the results drawn from the analysis of the quantitative approach, which require the research of the journal, article or paper published highlighting the possible reasons aur solution of the output.
 
*3.1	Relationship between indicators: Chi-square test and Logistic Regression*

In this report, two tests are used to understand the extent to which the status of company in the list (Survived or Not survived) is affected by other factors.
Chi-square test is a statistical method for hypothesis testing in which expected and observed frequencies of categorical variables are compared (Biswal, 2021). The goal of this test is to identify if the difference between the expected and actual data is random or is there any relationship between independent variables and this why chi-square test is an ideal choice for understanding association between categorical data (Biswal, 2021).
In this report, with the help of SPSS tool chi-square test is done to identify if the status of company (Survived/Not Survived) is associated with Sector or Country. The null hypothesis H0 is this case is that, there is no relation of association of sector or country with the status of company. Here Confidence Interval (CI) of 95% is taken and this of the significance level (p- value) is <= 0.05 then Null hypothesis is rejected, which means alternative hypothesis Ha is true, which assume that there is some relation between status of company and Sector or Country it belongs.
Apart from Sector and Country there are other variables in the dataset which are numerical variables and because chi-square test can be used only with categorical data, different approach for analysing the other variable is selected. Here the dependent variable is categorical and has only 2 values so, Logistic Regression is applied to find association of independent variables with dependent variable.
Logistic Regression estimate the probability of the occurrence of an event, since the output is probability so the result lie between 0 to 1. If the outcome is <.5 it will predict dependent variable as 0 else 1 and as opposed to linear regression, Logistic Regression does not require linear relationship between output and input (Zach, 2020).
Logistic function = 1/(1+e^-x),
where x is input/independent variable
In the given dataset the independent variables are “Revenue”, “Profit”, “Asset”, “Employees” are also present and they are continuous variables. So, to test the association of Status of company, which is categorical and bivariant, with Revenue, profit, Asset, Employees number, which is continuous value, Logistic Regression is used.


*3.1.1	Correlation between ranking and number of employee and assets*

Pearson's correlation coefficient serves as the statistical metric for quantifying the statistical connection or relationship between two continuous variables. It's regarded as the most reliable approach for assessing the association between the variables of interest because it relies on the covariance method (Turney, 2022). This metric provides insights into both the strength and direction of the correlation or association between the variables. The coefficient lies between -1 to +1, in which -1 shows strong negative relation and +1 shows strong positive relation while 0 shows no relation between variables.
 
*3.2	Qualitative Approach*

The study employs a descriptive approach to analyse the output we get from Quantitative approach. In this approach study focuses on finding the reason behind the gap in the market with the help of research study, article, report or journals published before from 2014 till 2022 and suggest the solution take can be taken to minimise the gap.


*3.3	Data source*

Fortune Global 500 list data is available on Fortune’s website. It contains the list of all the companies from year 2013 till 2022 along with the other information of company such as, Sector, Industry, Revenue, Profit, Assets, Employees, change in rank, Years on Global list. To cross verify the list data from someka website is also taken which has same list as on the Fortune website.

**CHAPTER 4: ANALYSIS AND RESULT**

*4.1.	Analysis*

***Research Question 1: How has the representation of Asian and non-Asian companies in the Fortune Global 500 changed over the past decade?***

Fig 1, highlight the change in the number of companies from different regions listed in the top 500 list between 2013 to 2022. The trend shows that there has been a continuous increase in the count of the companies in the list from Advance Asia region, which include- China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which is in contrast with those of Europe, U.S. and Other region
 
for which count has decreased by the end of 2022. For emerging Asia region, which include- India, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, the count is approximately constant.

Table 1, highlight that there has been approx. 22% increase for Advance Asian companies, 16% decrease for European companies, 19% decrease for other nation companies and only 6% decrease for U.S companies count in the Fortune Global 500 list from 2013 till 2022.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/7ffb5328-8505-4b16-8450-1cbf94e199d2)

**Specific to Asian Companies**
Table 2, shows that the count of Chinese companies in the list has increased more than 50% from 2013 but for Japan the count has decreased unlike all other nations in the same group of Advance Asia.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/cfa7b1cd-f562-4963-95d1-72b0729be7b8)






Table 3, highlights that the count of the companies in the list for emerging Asian companies is constant except for a very small increase in the count of Indian company.

 ![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/de4142fb-fdc4-4cfe-961e-f0d4c877e3bf)


***Research Question 1.1: How does the financial performance of Asian companies compare to the global average and within Asia itself?***


Table 4, shows that the average Profit share (inn%), calculated as Sum of the profit/number of companies in each region, has decreased for Emerging Asian companies from 2013 to 2022. The Profit share has decreased for Asian companies but increased for other regions.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/85d0d5b5-2bcd-4e9a-a3b7-3bd706e2e193)



Fig 2, shows that the Average Marginal profit, calculated as (Total Profit/Total Revenue)/Total number of companies for each region in 2013 and 2022, has increased more for European,U.S. and Other regions compared to that of the Asian companies.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/386a0d2d-d202-4079-a215-1defff4d4aac)



**Specific to Asian Companies**
Fig 3 and Fig 4, shows that the Average Marginal Profit, calculated as (Total Profit/Total Revenue)/Total number of companies for each country of Advance and Emerging Asian region in 2013 and 2022, has decreased for China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia while it increased for other country in 2022 compared to 2013.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/a04742bf-0c43-437c-b512-0961aa136399)

 

Also, from Fig 3 and Fig 4, it is observed that the sum of Average Profit Margin of Advance Asian Region is $0.16 and $0.24 respectively and for Emerging Asian Region is $0.29 and $0.28 in 2013 and 2022 respectively. Clearly in both the years the Marginal profit of Emerging Asian companies is mot than Advance Asian companies.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/8c952176-32e7-4257-b23d-f8a86a58dd40)




***Research Question 1.2. What changes have taken place in both the sectoral makeup and profit margins (in context of sector) within Asian companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 over the last decade?***
Fig 5. shows that count of companies Financial, Energy and Technology sector companies is higher compared to other sector in 2013 and 2022 but the count of companies in Health care sector has increased drastically in 2022 compared to 2013.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/e0deb509-2428-475c-adce-812d61336ddf)

 

Table 5, highlights that decrease in the count of the companies under Energy sector showed by all the region, highest for Asian companies whereas for Health sector there is increase in the count for all the region and almost constant number for Technology sector from 2013 to 2033. Surprisingly, while European and U.S. companies showed decrease in the count of companies under Finance sector, Asian companies under Finance sector showed approx. 42% increase in the count from 2013 to 2022.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/48b3ee7f-7ea7-4562-b8f1-9707ebc8cac2)


Table 6, shows that Average Marginal Profit, calculated as (Total Profit/ Total Revenue)/number of companies in each sector, has increased for all sector except for Health Care sector and it has sharply increased for Technology sector.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/b3d34526-b07b-4823-bfe2-ce720d90e2e2)




***Count of the companies in each sector specific to Asia***
Fig 6. illustrates that there are 2 major nations in Advance Asia- China and Japan, with higher number of companies. The count of the companies in Energy sector has decreased in 2022 compared to that in 2013 for all countries while in the same year, 2022, the count for health care sector companies has increased. The count of Japanese company under Technology sector has drastically decreased, up to 67%, in 2022 compared to that in 2013. For China, the count of firms under financials sector has also increased to 27 which was 15 in 2013. This increase in the count of financial sector companies is contributed by China, South Korea and Taiwan.

 ![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/aed3a7ae-cbc8-4026-8f74-65170df5c685)

 


Table 7 shows that the count of companies in Emerging Asian companies is almost same in 2013 and 2022. In the below table Health and Technology sector is not given because the count for these 2 sectors is 0.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/f98a269c-7c86-424e-9da6-abe3ae0bb5be)






**Profit Margin specific to Asia**
It is clear from Fig 7 and Fig 8, that the average marginal profit for Energy sector is very low. In fact, in 2013 Japan, South Korea and Taiwan the marginal profit was in negative and also in 2022 not much improvement in the profit margin can be seen for South Korean and Taiwan companies.
Under Financial sector, the Profit Margin for Chinese companies has decreased from 2013 to 2022 while it increased drastically in Taiwan region.
Under Technology sector, there is sharp increase in the marginal profit from 2013 to 2022 for all the countries in Advance Asia, especially for Chinese companies.
There is a rise in the profits margins in Technology sector from 2013 to 2022, despite a decline in Japanese company counts. Profit margins notably surged for all Advanced Asian companies in this sector, especially in 2022.

***Emerging Asia***
In Emerging Asian, from Fig 9 and Fig 10, the profit margin in 2022 under Finance sector for Indian company has decreased by more than half of that in 2013. While the technology sector seems to be profitable in recent year, no companies from Emerging Asia is listed in FG 500 list in 2022 which shows that Emerging Asian countries are not able to utilize the full potential in the technology sector market.

****Research Question 2: What factors influence companies drop off or survive on the Fortune Global 500 list over time and apart from revenue and profit, do asset and size of the company also affect the ranking of companies in the list?***


Overview on the survival of companies in FG 500 list from 2013 to 2022
Fig 11. shows that there are 340 companies out of 500 companies existed in both 2013 and 2022 list while 160 companies existed in 2013 but fail to exist in 2022 list.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/ad6ffcb9-2b8f-49c7-bc9b-433e57089fa6)

 
Table 8, shows that out of Asian, U.S. and European region, the highest percentage of the companies not able to survive in both the list is from European region companies while the highest percentage of the companies able to survive in both the list is from Emerging Asia.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/1d296337-2329-4be2-948f-18918af85d18)



***Specific to Asia***
From Table 9, it is clear that a large number of the companies from Energy sector fail to exist in both 2013 and 2022 list while country wise a large number of Japanese companies fail to exist in both 2013 and 2022 list. Also, in Emerging Asia only 2 out of 11 companies fail to exists in both list.
This could mean that Sector and Region of company might affect the longevity of a company in the FG 500 list. But this needs to be proved using quantitative method, so let’s further analyse the factors affecting the survival of the company in the list.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/512c2a39-4f85-4e78-bead-c114ee1da929)




***Chi-square test: Testing if the survival of the company in the list is affected by its sector and Region it is from.***
Using SPSS, chi-square test is done on Sector and Region against Survival of the company. The result is as below:
**For Sector verses Status**
From Table 10, the result of Chi-Square Tests, with Pearson Chi-Square method p-value (Significance value) is 0.003 and with Likelihood ration method p-value is
0.001. Since there are 15 cell or 35.7% of the cell, which is greater than 20%, having expected count <5, therefore we will consider p-value of Likelihood method. At 99% of C.I. p-value (0.001) is significant. Therefore, it is proved that survival of the company in the list is affected by the sector it belongs.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/85181f36-99f1-4ec8-8c32-58fb5f401869)


**For Region verses Status**
From Table11, Chi-square test result, p- value with Pearson Chi-Square is .114, which shows that at 99% of C.I. or even at 95% C.I. it can be said that Region of the country has no effect on the survival of the company in the list. However, it is unlikely because company’s revenue is highly affected by the government laws and GDP of the region. Therefore, it can be said that, at 88% of C.I. it can be said that region does affect the survival of the company because p-value is 0.114 which is less than 0.12.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/08b3585a-d138-4069-9420-91b359198544)


***Logistic regression: Testing if assets, revenue, number of employees and profit are significant factor for the survival of company in the list.***

From below table 12, it is clear that at 95% of C.I. Revenue, Profit, and number of employees are significant factor for the survival of the company in the list because p-value of Revenue, profit and Employees is less than 0.05.

![image](https://github.com/Pragati2693/Dissertation/assets/68961996/9dd8e5e8-7a32-40e6-ab2a-26cad04d2909)



From the above result, it is clear that profit, revenue and number of employees affect the survival of the company and because FG 500 list s based in revenue so, revenue and profit are the obvious factor. But, let’s further analyse if the asset and number of employees affect the ranking of the company in the list.

***Correlation coefficient (r): Relation between number of employees, Assets and Ranking of company in the list.***

Below table shows the Pearson’s product correlation, r value for assets and employees again ranks of the company in 2013 and 2022. [Code and result are attached in appendix]. In the result r- value is negative, means the higher the assets and number of employees value the lower is the rank.
In 2013, r value is same, -0.31, for both assets and employees, which means that both parameters equally affect the ranking of company but in 2022 the effect of assets on rank of the company is more than number of employees. Also, in the below result value of r is very less than -1, which shows that the relation between the Asset and Employees and Ranking of the company is not very strong.

4.2.	Result

Representation of Asian Companies in Fortune 500
•	Between 2013 and 2022, the Fortune 500 list witnessed a consistent rise in the representation of Asian firms, particularly from China, which saw a remarkable surge of over 50% in its company count during this period. In contrast, the number of Japanese companies on the list notably declined, despite the overall growth of Asian businesses. Meanwhile, the presence of companies from emerging Asian nations such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia remained relatively stable.
•	Asian companies on average exhibit lower profit margins in both 2013 and 2022 compared to the full Fortune 500 list. But the average profit margin for emerging Asian companies was higher than that of advanced Asian companies.
•	Energy, finance, automotive, and technology remain prominent sectors in the Fortune 500, with a recent increase in Asian financial companies. However, the number of energy companies, particularly in Asia, has declined over the past decade, while healthcare companies have significantly expanded their presence across all regions from 2013 to 2022
•	Although the count of Japanese tech companies decreased, the tech sector's profit margins surged from 2013 to 2022, notably driven by significant gains in profit margins among advanced Asian tech companies, particularly Chinese firms
Factors Influencing Company Survival
•	Sector significantly affects a company's Fortune 500 longevity, as revealed by chi- square test results, while region also plays a role, albeit not as prominently, according to the same tests
•	The results from logistic regression indicate that factors such as revenue, profit, and the number of employees significantly influence a company's ability to maintain its position on the Fortune 500 list over time
•	Correlation analysis reveals a negative relationship between assets/employees and company ranking, indicating that higher values are associated with better rankings.
 
However, this correlation is not very strong, suggesting that other factors also play a role in influencing ranking positions.



***CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION***

*5.1	Discussion**

*5.1.1	Existing problems*

Problem1: No significant growth in the count of emerging Asian companies in the last decade.
Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of Asian companies on the list, but there hasn't been a significant rise in companies from emerging Asia. This lack of growth is influenced by various factors, including structural vulnerabilities, governance issues, and the end of a commodities boom, which have hindered certain emerging markets. Given that most emerging economies still have income levels less than half of advanced economies, bridging this gap is a long-term effort (Ha, 2021).
Furthermore, the tightening of monetary policies in advanced economies has repercussions in emerging Asia. While depreciated currencies may lower export costs, they can also lead to local inflation, reducing consumer spending—a vital driver of growth in emerging Asia. Simultaneously, currency devaluation increases the cost of servicing foreign currency debt, adding more challenges to their economic recovery (Beattie, 2023)
Problem2: Decline in the count of Japanese firm in Technology, Energy and Financial sector companies in the last decade.
The Fortune report attributes the significant decrease in Japanese companies on the list to factors such as a devalued yen, a lack of innovative and emerging firms, and the rise of China. The weakened currency has led to higher energy and import costs for Japanese companies (Gordon, 2023). Additionally, Japan's absence of major tech firms at the top of the Global list is attributed to missing out on the internet boom, a relatively small number of STEM graduates, particularly among females, and a cautious investment culture (Gordon, 2023).
Furthermore, research by Chorafas (2014) highlights challenges faced by Japan's financial services sector, including the need for Japanese banks to expand internationally due to slow domestic growth and reduced interest margins. The financial services sector in Japan must adapt to macroeconomic shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes while ensuring sustained growth and meeting the diverse needs of stakeholders.
Problem 3: Why count and marginal profit in Taiwan, south Korea and China of energy sector is decreasing
As per a report published by McKinsey, one of the primary reasons behind the reduction in marginal profitability within the advanced Asian energy sector over the past decade was a cyclically challenging phase in energy and materials, contributing to 44% of the decline. Additionally, the global economic deceleration caused by the pandemic played a role.
 
Another analysis by IEA (2022), suggests that Southeast Asia encounters a dual task of augmenting overall investment within the energy sector while simultaneously raising the portion of this investment dedicated to clean energy technologies
Problem 4: the profit margin increase for Asian companies is very low compared to that of U.S., European and Other companies.
Asian companies often have lower profit margins compared to their counterparts in the US or Europe due to a variety of reasons that stem from economic, structural, and market factors.
One possible explanation is that Chinese companies often exhibit lower gross margins compared to their US or European counterparts, resulting in elevated costs of goods sold relative to their revenues (Sather, 2023). Another factor might be the presence of increased taxes, regulatory obstacles, and competition in both the domestic and international markets for Chinese firm (Zhou, 2022)
Also, Labor costs in certain Asian countries can be comparatively lower, which might lead to reduced production costs but could also translate to lower selling prices and margins.


*5.1.2	Solutions*
The analysis reveals that there has been a limited increase in the presence of Emerging Asian companies in the Fortune Global 500 list over the past decade, with China being a notable exception. To address this disparity, a combination of business, policy, and economic strategies is essential. While China has shown impressive growth in company count, their profit margins lag behind the United States. Encouraging international expansion and supporting private enterprises can enhance efficiency and profitability in China (Bright, 2013; Chen et al., 2021).
Japanese companies, once dominant in the Fortune Global 500, have seen a decline in recent years. To regain their position, investment in R&D and fostering innovation are crucial. A customized approach to change management, as recommended in an EY report, can help Japanese companies adapt and remain competitive (Ngou, 2021).
South Korea and Taiwan, despite suffering Japanese occupation during World War II, have successfully revived their economies. In the health sector, these countries have notable companies, such as GC Pharma, OBI Pharma, IHH Health Care, and Clearbridge Health. ASEAN's focus on strengthening health system cooperation can lead to improved public health outcomes in Southeast Asia (Chongsuvivatwong et al., 2011).
In India, the finance sector has witnessed a significant decline in profit margins since 2012, impacting economic growth. A well-capitalized and low-bad-loan banking sector is crucial for higher economic growth, as highlighted in IMF research (MacDonald and Xu, 2022).
In summary, the analysis underscores the need for strategic interventions across various Asian economies to address disparities in company representation and profitability. Emphasizing innovation, international expansion, and sector-specific improvements can enhance their competitiveness and contribute to sustained economic growth.
 
*5.1.3	Limitations*

The Fortune Global 500 provides a limited view of the Asian corporate landscape, as it focuses on large revenue-based firms, potentially missing other important players (small and Medium enterprises). The findings are historical and may not predict future trends, requiring ongoing monitoring of evolving Asian economies. Regional analysis might hide variations among individual nations at different development stages, so more detailed assessments are needed. Subjectivity in categorizing firms may introduce inconsistencies. The 10-year window limits dynamic modelling. In conclusion, this research offers a starting point for understanding Asia's corporate landscape, but ongoing monitoring, broader analysis, and data refinement are essential to overcome these limitations. Also, while analysing the factors affecting the survival of the company there are more important factors that should be considered such as, innovative capability, organizational system, resources, organizational culture and strategy associated but these factors cannot be quantified and thus are missing from this dissertation.


*5.1.4	Enhancement*

Below are the improvements that could be implemented if the same task were undertaken once more:
•	Broaden the literature review to encompass books and reports specifically cantered on Asian corporations.
•	Seek input from academics and experts in the early stages of researching the Asian corporate landscape and enhance quantitative data with primary surveys and interviews to gain qualitative insights.
•	Integrate case studies of prominent companies to illustrate and enhance the analysis.
•	Concentrate on a narrower set of dimensions and research questions for more in- depth analysis rather than a broad overview.
•	Maintain a consistent structure and logical flow as the analysis extends beyond the original scope.
In conclusion, there are numerous intriguing perspectives that can further enhance the examination of Asian corporations through the Fortune Global 500 dataset and additional resources. The proposed inquiries revolve around global strategy, governmental initiatives, case studies, predictive models, and incorporating broader viewpoints.


*5.1.5	Future Work*

Below are the future work that can continue on this dissertation:
•	Extend the analysis to encompass more years of Fortune Global 500 data for a comprehensive view of long-term trends.
•	Include data on SMEs and private companies to broaden the perspective beyond large listed firms.
•	Conduct primary research by conducting surveys and interviews with Asian companies to gain qualitative insights.
•	Investigate the influence of specific economic and political events on corporate trends.
•	Compare business environments across Asian countries to pinpoint factors contributing to success.
 
•	Acquire detailed financial data to facilitate ratio analysis and deeper performance evaluation.
•	Utilize forecasting models to anticipate future trends and scenarios.
•	Correlate corporate trends with national competitiveness indexes to provide additional context.


**5.2	Conclusion**

The research explored various dimensions, such as geography, industry sectors, finances, and company survival rates. It found that Asian, particularly Chinese, companies have gained prominence due to Asia's economic growth, while growth varied across subregions. Asian companies prioritize scale over profit, with emerging ones outperforming advanced ones in profit margins. Sectors like finance saw growth, while energy declined. European companies faced challenges. In conclusion, Asia's multinational presence has grown, but challenges remain in competitiveness, profitability, and global reach, with the next decade determining success.
Analysing Asian companies in the Fortune Global 500 over the past decade offers valuable insights into the evolving corporate landscape in Asia. This research benefits Asian firms seeking global growth and profitability by identifying trends and growth opportunities. Policymakers can use the findings to target investments and reforms for improved corporate competitiveness. Scholars can use this framework for further research on topics like internationalization and performance. Additionally, the survival analysis provides lessons on resilience and adaptation to economic shocks for companies in Asia and beyond.
